<h1>Join the Project</h1>

<p>
PixelHearts is currently a passion project being built by people who simply love games, creativity, and internet culture.
</p>

<p>
Right now there is no funding and no pay. Everyone involved is here because they want to build something cool, meet creative people, and be part of a community driven project.
</p>

<p>
If the project grows, becomes playable, or eventually makes money, the goal is to share success with the people who helped build it.

<h2>The Honest Part</h2>

<p>
This is not a studio with investors.
This is not a corporate project.
This is not a job posting.
</p>

<p>
This is a group of people building something fun together.
</p>

<p>
If you're here for passion, learning, experimenting, and creating something nostalgic and new, you’re exactly who we want.
</p>

<h2>The Vision</h2>

<p>
I’m not a coder or animator. I'm a creative with a vision.
</p>

<p>
The vision is simple: bring back the feeling the internet used to have.
</p>

<p>
When places like Gaia Online, RuneScape, MySpace, and old web communities felt alive.
</p>

<p>
PixelHearts is about bringing community and gaming back together again.

<h2>About the Name</h2>

<p>
PixelHearts is currently just the project name.
</p>

<p>
The final game name may change later if something better appears.
</p>

<p>
Right now it's simply a codename while we build the idea.
