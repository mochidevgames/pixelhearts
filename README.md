PixelHearts

Project Codename — Experimental Virtual Grid Viewer

PixelHearts is an early-stage passion project exploring the future of browser-based social virtual worlds.

Inspired by platforms like Second Life, Gaia Online, and IMVU, the goal is to experiment with a new generation of grid-based online spaces focused on creativity, customization, and community.

This project is very early and currently serves as a concept, collaboration hub, and starting point for builders who want to explore the idea.

The Idea

PixelHearts aims to become a modern Grid Viewer for a shared virtual world.

Instead of a single massive MMO map, the world is made of connected regions that players can move between freely.

Example grid concept:

Central Plaza
Marketplace
Creator Sandbox
Nightclubs
Player Housing
Event Regions

At the start, the goal is much smaller:

Build one shared space where people can walk around, interact, and test ideas.

If the project grows, the grid expands.

Project Status

Early concept / prototype planning.

Current focus:

• Project vision
• Website hub
• Community building
• Contributor interest

Future development will depend on collaboration and interest from contributors.

There are currently no promises or deadlines.

Core Goals

The long-term vision explores features similar to modern virtual world platforms while pushing customization and creator freedom further.

Possible systems include:

• Full 3D camera controls
• Walking avatars
• Deep avatar customization
• Attachment systems
• Lighting and atmosphere
• Animated objects and characters
• Interactive environments

The focus is on enabling creativity rather than restricting it.

Why This Exists

Many early internet communities had a special feeling that modern platforms lost.

Places where people:

• hung out
• built things
• expressed themselves
• made friends

PixelHearts exists to explore whether that feeling can be brought back using modern technology.

Important Notes

PixelHearts is currently:

• a passion project
• unfunded
• experimental

There is no company behind it yet and no guaranteed outcome.

If the project evolves into something bigger, we will figure out the future together.

Who We're Looking For

Anyone interested in virtual worlds, social platforms, or creative experiments is welcome.

Examples:

Developers
3D Artists
Animators
UI Designers

Experience level does not matter.

Students and hobbyists are welcome.

Current Direction (Technical)

Exact technologies are still open, but likely areas include:

Frontend
• WebGL
• Three.js or Babylon.js

Networking
• WebSockets
• Node.js

World Structure
• Region based grid
• Expandable environments

This may change as contributors join.

Final Thought

If you ever missed the early internet worlds where people just logged in and existed together…

You already understand the spirit of this project.
