<p align="center"> <h1 align="center" style="font-family:serif;"> Pixel Hearts </h1> <p align="center"> <em>A creative sandbox for builders, artists, and explorers</em> </p> </p>
Overview

Project: Pixel Hearts is an experimental virtual grid concept exploring shared digital worlds.

Inspired by past virtual communities, it combines modern usability with creative freedom.

Note: This is a passion project, not a commercial MMO.

Think of it as:

A sandbox for ideas

A collaborative digital frontier

Community-driven exploration

Goals

Creative Freedom: user-built environments, avatars, and content

Modular Worlds: connected regions with scalable design

Creator-First: open collaboration, idea-driven growth

Current Focus

Website and documentation

Concept visualization

Community feedback

Proof-of-concept single region

No promises or deadlines — just building something interesting together.

Inspiration

Pixel Hearts draws from:

Virtual worlds: Second Life, IMVU, Gaia Online

Classic social platforms: Myspace, early forums

Modern platforms: Discord, Steam

Goal: combine nostalgia with modern usability.
