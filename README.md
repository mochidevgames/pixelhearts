Experimental Virtual Grid Viewer

A passion project exploring the future of social virtual worlds in the browser.

Inspired by
Second Life •
Gaia Online •
IMVU

Project Status

Early concept stage.

This repository currently focuses on:

• Vision
• Documentation
• Website hub
• Community building

Development will grow as contributors join.

There are no promises or timelines yet.

The Idea

PixelHearts is designed as a Grid Viewer rather than a traditional MMO.

Instead of one giant world, the platform connects multiple regions together.

Example layout:

Central Plaza
Marketplace
Nightclubs
Creator Spaces
Player Housing
Event Worlds

Players move freely between these locations while keeping their avatar and identity.

We start with one shared space, then expand outward.

Vision

The internet used to have places where people simply existed together.

Old communities like forums, profile pages, and early virtual worlds created spaces where creativity and identity mattered.

PixelHearts explores whether that feeling can be rebuilt with modern technology.

Goals include:

• expressive avatars
• creative communities
• customizable spaces
• user-driven environments

Core Exploration

These are areas the project hopes to explore over time.

Avatar Systems

• walking and movement
• deep customization
• wearable attachments
• expressive animation

World Systems

• connected grid regions
• social hubs
• player environments
• interactive objects

Visual Systems

• dynamic lighting
• atmosphere
• environmental design

These ideas are directional, not promises.

Philosophy

Start small.
Build openly.
Let people shape the project.

PixelHearts is less about shipping a product and more about exploring what a modern social world could become.

Who We're Looking For

Anyone curious about virtual worlds.

Examples include:

Developers
3D Artists
Animators
UI Designers
Writers
World Builders
Students
Hobbyists

You do not need to be an expert.

Curiosity and creativity matter more.
